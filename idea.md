# This is my script for generating README and user documentation for my projects
# It highly simplifies whatever time you need to invest in writing a README.md file

Things that I require
    -- Location of the file that should be generated i.e. README.md
    -- Name of the projects
    -- Github repo
    -- LICENSE
    -- Instructions regarding Things
    -- Custom Instructions
    

## Points to be noted: 

- The readme should go through a specific layout
- The should contain various variables that should be finally written ata the Location
- The readme should contain emojis and text formatting options 
- The instructions to run the programme must be Custom
- The README should be later generated
- This program should just generate the base of the readme where the later part should be written

- The layout should be separated by -- such that the program should be able to slice it accordingly
